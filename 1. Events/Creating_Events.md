# Creating Events

If you've created your folder or editing an existing one, you can take on doing the event itself.

Reminder:
* GT5: `textdata/gt5/<aspec_event/license/etc>`
* GT6: `game_parameter/gt6/<license/event/etc>`

If you are using GT6, you can create your own event using the [Event Maker](https://github.com/Nenkai/GTEventGenerator/releases). It will allow you to directly export events as XML along with their folders.

If you're editing directly through notepad, you can refer to the [XML documentation itself](https://github.com/Nenkai/GT-File-Specifications-Documentation/tree/master/Docs).

**Note for GT6** - You might also notice these `.fgp` files - You will need to remove them from the `PDIPFS` in order for the game to bypass its event cache or no changes will occur.
