# Creating Events

If you've created your folder or editing an existing one, you can take on doing the event itself.

Reminder:
* GT5: `textdata/gt5/<aspec_event/license/etc>`
* GT6: `game_parameter/gt6/<license/event/etc>`

If you are using GT6, you are strongly recommended to create your own event using the [Event Maker](https://github.com/Nenkai/GTEventGenerator/releases). It will allow you to directly export events as XML along with their folders. It is also well documented, most labels will show information while hovering them.

However if you're still editing directly through a text/code editor, you can refer to the [XML documentation itself](https://github.com/Nenkai/GT-File-Specifications-Documentation/tree/master/Docs).
If you're creating an event make sure it matches the IDs for your folders in either GT5 or GT6, including the xml file names.

**Note for GT6** - If you are editing original events, you might also notice these `.fgp` files - You will need to remove them from the `PDIPFS` in order for the game to bypass its event cache or no changes will occur.
